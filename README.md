# Overview

ABCoder is a comprehensive open-source software development tool that aims to utilize artificial intelligence to enhance
the process of coding. This project focuses on various aspects of software development ranging from repository analysis,
issue and pull request tracking, to automated code compression, development guidance, testing enhancement, and
refactoring guidance.

# Status Update

The system is designed to automatically fetch the latest data from Github upon triggering relevant tasks, ensuring the
repository status is always up-to-date. It can answer queries related to function, defects based on issue and PR
information. For more details, check out our Issues and Pull Requests sections on Github.

# Lossless Compression

The system also offers a lossless compression feature for repository code. The specific implementation methods are being
optimized, and more details will be available soon.

# Development Guide

We welcome all developers wishing to contribute to ABCoder. Our system provides detailed guidance for manual development
and also supports auto-generation of instructions. Check out our Contribution Guide for more information.

# Testing Enhancements

The system is designed to analyze existing functions and corresponding tests, identify the overall quality of testing,
produce reports, and automatically generate test cases for weakly covered items. Our goal is to help repositories
enhance and perfect their test cases.

# Refactor/Rewrite Guide

We offer guidance for both small-scale feature iterations and large-scale rewrites, including language stack switches.
Our system provides a detailed guide for manual development and also supports automated guidance generation.

# Getting Involved

We encourage developers to contribute and make this tool more powerful. If you are interested in contributing to ABCoder
project, kindly check out our Getting Involved Guide.
